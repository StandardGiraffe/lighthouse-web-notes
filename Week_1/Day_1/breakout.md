# Day 1 Breakout: The Curriculum

Take notes, and remember that any code that the instructor produces will be sent out afterwards, so try to follow along, rather than type along.

## Weeks 1 to 4

### Week 1
Software Development - What is software development, and how do I get it to do what I want.  Pairing.

### Week 2
How the web works, HTTP, REST, and mock test.

### Week 3 - Frontend

### Week 4 - Midterm Project starts.

### Week 5 - Offsite week.
Still a full week's content, but we'll be at home, meeting in coffee shops, etc.  Focus on computer science and data structures.  Algorythems and complexity.
Limited mentor support.

## Weeks 6 - 10: Frameworks.

### Week 6 - React Project

### Week 7 - Ruby, Object-Oriented Programming

### Week 8-9 - Final project, Advanced lectures (make requests based on interest.)


## 4 Evaluated Projects
* week 2 - TinyApp URL shortener
* Week 3 - Tweeter
* Week 4 - Midterm Project (team)
* Week 6 - Chatty (slack clone)

## 2 unevaluated projects

## 4 Tech Interviews
Weeks 2, 3, 8, 9.  Interviews will cover what was discussed in the previous week, with the later interviews closer to a real-world interview.

## Quizzes
(Multiple choice, can be taken multiple times.)

## Assessment Test
W2D5 Real and Mock tests will be take-homes.

## Notes:
Midterms will be assigned approaching week 4.

Start thinking about the final project.  What are things that irk you, that technology and web-apps could solve?

As we go through through the program/curriculum, we'll be expected to develop research practices.

During lectures, pay attention to how intermediate/senior programmers would approach a program.  Make notes of areas where we want more information/knowledge.

We can also ask assistants for deep-dives.

# Deep dive begins.

Get familiar with the Terminal.

When working with Git: The Main branch should contain code that works (sane), and code that's in production should occupy branches.

Fork (GitHub: Copy a repository and gain control of it)
Clone (Git: Copy a repository onto your local computer.)
Branch (Git: Copy out a file to work on, and version-control.)

Recommended that at each successful change, commit the change and explain what you did (for future self.)

When using `parseInt([string to parse], ___ )` Add a second argument, 10, to parse as decimal.

Refactoring: Only changing the shape of the code---not changing functionality.

### Once the branch is finished and ready to be merged:
```
git add .
git commit -m "explanation"
git checkout master // switches back to the master branch
git merge [branch name]
```

## Paired Programming Best practices:
Rally-racing metaphor: navigator and driver
Initial driver should be the person with the least experience, so that the navigator is thinking long-term and solving the problem, and the driver is working on syntax.
Navigator should *not* touch the keyboard.
